# emaillm

## Intro
This email contains the code that I used to set up an LLM-assisted Email to Calendar Helper. You can read more about this [here]()

## Setting up
Setting up is relatively straightforward. You can follow this [google colab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gmail-add-ons#0), replacing wherever necessary to your needs. I have two folders, one works with Open AI's chat gpt, and another with a mistral-instruct model . Make sure you set the necessary values (OPENAI_KEY for the chat gpt, and PROXY_URL if you're using mistral on a different URL).
